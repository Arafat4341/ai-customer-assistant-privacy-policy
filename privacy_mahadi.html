  <h2>1. No External Data Collection</h2>

    This app is a BYO (Bring Your Own) integration created solely for the MahadiTech Facebook Page.
    It does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process personal data from users outside Facebook Messenger.

  <p>
    All messages remain within Facebook Messenger and are handled according to Facebook’s own data policies.
