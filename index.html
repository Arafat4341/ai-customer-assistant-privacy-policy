  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    Muin accesses Facebook Page messages to help business owners respond to customer inquiries.
    We store Page messages and conversation history in our database for convenience, so that
    business owners can view all conversations in their dashboard and easily trace back to
    a chat when verifying or confirming an order.
  </p>

  <p>
    Data such as Page IDs, access tokens, and conversation logs are stored securely to enable
    messaging functionality. This data is retained only while the Page is connected to Muin
    and deleted upon disconnection. All data is transmitted over HTTPS and stored with restricted access.
  </p>

  <p>
    Business owners can revoke Muin’s access to their Page at any time through Facebook settings.
    No data is sold or shared with third parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    Muin processes data in accordance with Meta’s Platform Terms and applicable privacy regulations.
